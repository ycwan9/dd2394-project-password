# Password Cracking project

Group: [Group 4 / Bailin Lei | Yousra Al Mowahed | Yuchen Wang]


## Problem statement

Weak and improperly stored passwords remain a primary attack vector for account compromise. This project demonstrates common password-cracking techniques and simple protection mechanisms so students can:

‚Ä¢ see how attackers recover weak passwords (brute-force, dictionary, rainbow-table),

‚Ä¢ measure time‚Äìspace tradeoffs (especially for rainbow tables),

‚Ä¢ observe how simple defenses (unique salts, slow hashing) affect attack feasibility,

‚Ä¢ and learn secure password-storage best practices by contrast.

The implementations are educational: they favor clarity and short runtimes (using fast hashes such as MD5/SHA-1/SHA-224) so experiments finish quickly. Do not use these fast hashes for real user passwords.

## Background & Motivation

Passwords remain the dominant authentication mechanism. Storing passwords in plaintext is insecure: any breach yields immediate credential compromise. Instead systems store a digest produced by a cryptographic hash function. However, attackers use offline cracking methods to recover passwords from hashes. Understanding these methods and their costs is central to designing safe password storage practices (unique salts, slow hashing).

Key terms:

‚Ä¢ Hash function: deterministic mapping H:{0,1}‚àó‚Üí{0,1}ùëõthat is one-way and collision resistant (ideally).

‚Ä¢ Salt: a random per-password value ùë†combined with the password before hashing.

‚Ä¢ Reduction function: in rainbow tables, a deterministic mapping from hash space back to candidate passwords.

## Why hash passwords and why salt?
## Hashing rationale

‚Ä¢ Confidentiality: Storage of ùêª(ùëù) (instead of ùëù) prevents immediate exposure of plaintext if a leak occurs.

‚Ä¢ Verification: Authentication checks ùêª(ùëùcandidate)=?ùêª(ùëùstored).

‚Ä¢ One-way property: Hashes should make inversion (recovering ùëùfrom ùêª(ùëù)) computationally infeasible.

## Role of salts

Salts are random, unique per account values ùë†stored alongside hash output. Salting provides:

‚Ä¢ Rainbow-table defense: Precomputed hash‚Üíplaintext tables target a single hash mapping; adding a unique salt changes outputs and invalidates generic tables.

‚Ä¢ Hiding reuse: Identical passwords across accounts produce different salted hashes, preventing easy detection of shared credentials.

‚Ä¢ Cost increase for attackers: With unique salts, attackers must perform expensive work for each account rather than reuse precomputation.

Best practice: use a unique, cryptographically-random salt per password and prefer memory-hard slow hashes (Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt) in production.

## How the cracking algorithms work
## Brute-force attack

‚Ä¢ What: Try every possible candidate from a defined charset and length range.

‚Ä¢ How: Generate candidates (e.g., 'a'..'z', lengths 1..L), compute the hash for each candidate, and compare it to the target hash.

‚Ä¢ When effective: Small keyspaces (e.g., PINs, very short passwords).

‚Ä¢ Complexity: Exponential in password length: if charset size is |C| and max length L, candidates ‚âà ‚àë_{k=1..L} |C|^k.

‚Ä¢ Mitigation: Use long, high-entropy passwords and slow hashing functions to make each hash check expensive.

## Dictionary attack

‚Ä¢ What: Try likely human-chosen passwords from a curated wordlist (optionally with simple transforms like capitalization, suffix numbers).

‚Ä¢ How: Iterate the list, optionally apply transformations (password -> Password1, leet substitutions), hash each candidate, compare to the target.

‚Ä¢ When effective: Most real-world passwords are weak or based on words ‚Äî a small wordlist often yields many matches quickly.

‚Ä¢ Mitigation: Enforce password complexity, check against known breach lists, and use unique salts + slow hashes.

## Rainbow-table attack (time‚Äìspace tradeoff)

‚Ä¢ What: Precompute and store chains of alternating hash and reduction operations so many hashes can be cracked faster at lookup time, at the cost of precomputation and storage.

‚Ä¢ How : Choose a reduction function R that maps a hash back to a candidate password; for many starting seeds s, compute a chain:
```
s -> H(s) -> R(H(s)) -> H(R(H(s))) -> R(H(...)) -> ... (t steps)
```

Store only the pair (start, end) for each chain.
Given a target hash, simulate reduction/hash sequences (for up to t steps) looking for any chain end in the table; if you hit an endpoint, reconstruct the chain from its start to find the matching plaintext.

‚Ä¢ Key idea: Spend time and storage up front (build phase) so future lookups are faster.

‚Ä¢ Limitations: Chains can merge (collisions), lowering coverage; reduction design matters (classical rainbow tables use step-dependent reductions R_i to reduce merges).

‚Ä¢ Why salts break it: A unique salt changes the hash output for the same password, so a single rainbow table (which assumes a fixed hash function with no per-password variation) cannot be reused ‚Äî the attacker must rebuild tables for each salt, making the attack impractical.

There's also a more interior testing demo in the package's `__main__`.
```

python -m attacks.rainbow_table --charset abc --max-len 2 --chain-len 3 --random-seeds 3 --log-level INFO
```

## Functional testing (what to run to verify behavior)

Brute-force

‚Ä¢ Create a trivial target (e.g., password ab with charset abc, max length 2) and confirm brute_force_attack finds it.

‚Ä¢ Test both plaintext mode and hashed-no-salt mode: compute hash(password) with the same algorithm, then run the hashed brute-force.

Dictionary attack

‚Ä¢ Prepare a small wordlist containing one or two known passwords; verify the attack finds them.

‚Ä¢ Test with/without salts (salt prepended in this project).

Rainbow table

‚Ä¢ Build a tiny rainbow table (charset abc, max-len 2, small chain length and few seeds), then run lookup against known hashes within that small space. Confirm found plaintexts match.

‚Ä¢ Save and load the table (note the storage format ‚Äî pickles are used in the prototype).

Salted hashing demo

‚Ä¢ Generate salted hashes through utils/hashing.py and ensure brute-force/dictionary behavior matches expected difficulty changes.

## Performance testing (benchmarks)
Metrics to collect

‚Ä¢ Build time ‚Äî time to build the rainbow table (approx proportional to m * t).

‚Ä¢ Crack time ‚Äî per-target min/max/avg/stdev across sample targets, number of iterations.

‚Ä¢ Success rate ‚Äî fraction of sampled targets cracked by the table (empirical coverage).

‚Ä¢ Merge ratio ‚Äî empirical_coverage / theoretical_coverage (diagnostic for reduction function and chain merges).

Theoretical coverage estimate

For parameters:

‚Ä¢ m = number of chains

‚Ä¢ t = chain length

A first-order optimistic estimate:
```
coverage ‚âà 1 - exp(-m * t / N)
```
This ignores merges and collisions; empirical coverage is typically lower.

## How to run benchmarks

Use benchmark_rainbow.py:

‚Ä¢ --cracking-method all runs exhaustive tests (only feasible for small N).

‚Ä¢ --cracking-method montecarlo performs random-sampling benchmarking (use for larger spaces).

Suggested workflow:

‚Ä¢ Start with a tiny space (charset=abc, L=2) and verify correctness (exhaustive).

‚Ä¢ Scale to Monte Carlo sampling for larger parameter sets.

‚Ä¢ Vary m and t systematically; collect build time, success rate, and crack-time statistics.

## Example small benchmark command
```
python benchmark_rainbow.py \
  --charset abc \
  --max-len 2 \
  --chain-len 3 \
  --random-seeds 100 \
  --cracking-method montecarlo \
  --montecarlo-samples 1000
```

Interpreting results

‚Ä¢ If empirical success rate is far below the theoretical estimate, chain merges or poor reduction design are likely causes ‚Äî consider step-dependent reductions (classic rainbow approach).

‚Ä¢ Build time should roughly scale with m * t. If not, check for logging or I/O overhead and optimize.

‚Ä¢ For given m, increasing t has diminishing returns because chains start to overlap.

## Benchmark results

We run benchmark in a password space of all lower case letters (a-z) with maximum length of 3.

For the table build time, we observe it bilinear relation with chain number and chain length, which meets with the expected result and algorithm complexity analysis.

![plot of build time](img/bench_time.png)

The success rate increases with larger chain number or chain length, however, the increment weakens gradually when the total counts approaches password space size, resulting a decreased table efficiency. This is shown in Philippe Oechslin's original work.

![plot of success rate](img/bench_rate.png)

We measure the average cracking time by the number of iterations (total number of calls to reduction/hash function) per cracking. The result shows a quadratic relation with chain length, which meets the algorithm complexity analysis.

![plot of cracking iterations](img/bench_count.png)

## Test artifacts and CI 

‚Ä¢ Add unit tests (pytest) for:

‚Ä¢ utils.hashing ‚Äî hashing and salt handling.

‚Ä¢ brute_force_attack ‚Äî small-space known password recovery.

‚Ä¢ dictionary_attack ‚Äî wordlist handling, salt behavior.

‚Ä¢ rainbow_table ‚Äî round-trip build ‚Üí lookup on a tiny space.

Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on PRs and optionally run a tiny benchmark job nightly.

## Safety and security considerations in testing

‚Ä¢ Never unpickle files from unknown sources in your tests or in CI.

‚Ä¢ When demonstrating secure hashing (Argon2/bcrypt), do it in a separate secure-mode in code because these slow hashes are expensive for tests ‚Äî use low-cost Argon2 parameters only in demo mode.

Yousra created the initial version of the password-cracking toolkit, establishing the project‚Äôs folder structure and modular architecture. She implemented the first working versions of all main attack methods: brute-force (plaintext and hashed), dictionary attack, and rainbow-table attack.

She also added support for multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224) through Python‚Äôs hashlib, and implemented a basic password strength checker to demonstrate password evaluation. Her early prototype validated the project‚Äôs concept and ensured all algorithms interacted correctly.

Yousra‚Äôs work provided the foundation for later optimization, testing, and documentation. Her structured design and clean module separation made it easy for the team to expand the codebase efficiently.

## Yuchen Wang ‚Äî Optimization and Rainbow Table Fixes

Yuchen rewrote and optimized the rainbow-table attack module, which was partially functional in the initial version. He redesigned the hash‚Äìreduction chain logic, fixed table generation errors, and ensured correct plaintext recovery through improved chain traversal.

He also enhanced benchmarking and performance testing, introducing both exhaustive and Monte Carlo modes for evaluating success rates and runtime efficiency. Yuchen improved code readability, parameter handling, and serialization safety for the rainbow-table module, making it robust and reproducible.

His technical contributions transformed the rainbow-table implementation into a correct, measurable, and optimized attack demonstration ‚Äî the core analytical component of this project.

## Bailin Lei ‚Äî Documentation, Testing, and Final Integration

Bailin authored the README and testing documentation, clearly describing the algorithms, their principles, and performance evaluation methods. He organized the project report into the required sections ‚Äî Problem Statement, References, Documentation of Project, and Documentation on Testing.

He also set up a testing framework for verifying correctness and performance, covering brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow-table modules. Bailin coordinated the integration of Yousra‚Äôs and Yuchen‚Äôs contributions, ensuring consistent imports, formatting, and cross-platform compatibility, turning the technical implementation into a clear, reproducible, and well-documented academic submission.
